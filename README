What it does:
For just Lab1a, we parse the shell script and print out the commands in standard form.
For Lab1a and Lab1b, we have the ability to parse the commands and print it out in standard form or perform what the shell would do with the shell script.

Lab 1a Implementations:
-t flag to indicate you only want to print the shell script
Simple Commands
Subshell Commands
Until Commands
While Commands
If Commands
Comments
Simple Syntax Error Checking

Lab1a Semi-Implementations:
Sequence Commands: only works with simple commands
Pipe Commands: only works with simple commands
Input/Output implementation: only simple cases work.

Lab1b Implementation:
Should be implmented fully
Simple Commands
Subshell Commands
Until Commands
While Commands
If Commands

Limitations:
Since this is Lab1b, we have not implemented the profiling implementation yet
